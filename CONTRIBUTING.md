So, let's define several rules for contributing.

- There is no need for multiple lecture notes pdf files. If there is one, keep it one.
- If there are multiple Lab/Past Exam/Homework etc. files, please mkdir a parent directory that annotates your year. For example "YTU-CE/3x5/BLM3021 - Algorithm Analysis/Homeworks/2020-2021/"
- If you are not sure with your solutions (for exams or homeworks), please don't add it. Wrong or incomplete answers can confuse people.
